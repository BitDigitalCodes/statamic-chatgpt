  type: textarea
  instructions: 'ChatGPT works the best when you tell it how you want it to behave before asking for the actual content. For example, if you run an online magazine about chemistry you might want to tell ChatGPT that it is a scientist with a background in chemistry, to give it context. You can use this area to preface all requests with this prompt. Try and keep it short though, as it will use up your tokens on each request.'
  placeholder: 'You are an expert in gardening and nature, with a successful history of writing for online gardening magazines. You write compelling articles, that are SEO-optimized, and include links to relevant external websites.'
